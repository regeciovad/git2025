# Research Report

## Introduction

This document provides a summary of the research conducted on the effects of different chemical compounds on plant growth. The results are presented in the form of tables and charts.

## Materials and Methods

### Materials

- **Chemical Compounds**: 
  - Compound A
  - Compound B
  - Compound C
- *Plants*: 
  - [x] Species 1
  - [ ] Species 2
  - [ ] Species 3

This is really ***very*** important text.

~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.

H~2~O, X^2^

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
	\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi I \xi x}
	\,d\xi
$$


### Methods

1. Prepare the plant samples.
2. Apply the chemical compounds to the plants.
3. Measure the growth over a period of 30 days.

## Results

### Growth Data

The table below shows the average growth (in cm) of each plant species when treated with different chemical compounds.

| Plant Species | Control | Compound A | Compound B | Compound C |
|---------------|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| Species 1     | 10.2    | 15.3       | 12.7       | 14.1       |
| Species 2     | 9.8     | 14.6       | 11.9       | 13.5       |
| Species 3     | 11.4    | 16.0       | 13.2       | 15.0       |

### Code

The following points summarize the statistical analysis of the data:

```
Standard Deviation:
  - Control: 0.82 cm
  - Compound A: 0.72 cm
  - Compound B: 0.65 cm
  - Compound C: 0.63 cm
```

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

## Discussion

The application of Compound A resulted in the highest average growth across all plant species. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and long-term effects.

## Conclusion

The research indicates that Compound A significantly promotes plant growth compared to the control and other compounds. Future research should focus on optimizing the concentration and application methods.
